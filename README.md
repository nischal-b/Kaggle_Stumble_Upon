# Kaggle_Stumble_Upon
 StumbleUpon Evergreen Classification Challenge :
 
StumbleUpon is a user-curated web content discovery engine that recommends relevant, high quality pages and media to its users, based on their interests. While some pages StumbleUpon recommends, such as news articles or seasonal recipes, are only relevant for a short period of time, others maintain a timeless quality and can be recommended to users long after they are discovered. In other words, pages can either be classified as "ephemeral" or "evergreen". The ratings StumbleUpon gets from their community gives them strong signals that a page may no longer be relevant - but what if they could make this distinction ahead of time? A high-quality prediction of "ephemeral" or "evergreen" would greatly improve a recommendation system like theirs.

StumbleUpon gave a challenge in Kaggle to create a classifier model, which will evaluate a large set of URLs and label them as either evergreen or ephemeral.
